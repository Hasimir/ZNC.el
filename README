It's a ZNC "mode"

Aint that exciting?

$ git clone https://sshirokov@github.com/sshirokov/ZNC.el.git

Make sure the contents of the repo, or $REPO/znc.el is on your load path.

(require 'znc)
M-x customize-group znc RET
;; Add a server, add some usernames and passwords.
;; To use (for now, until I figure out the (interactive ..) interface):
(znc-erc 'a-network-slug-you-confugured)


==> Or, semi-interactively:
M-: (znc-erc 'a-network-slug-you-confugured)

You should now have an *irc-network-slug* buffer that is an ERC server buffer, 
and whatever channels you attach to on login.

/reconnect will recycle the hell out of the server buffer.

That's more or less it for now. Since I use it, I should be developing it 
somewhat frequently until it meets all of my needs.
