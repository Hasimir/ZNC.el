It's a ZNC "mode"

Aint that exciting?

$ git clone https://sshirokov@github.com/sshirokov/ZNC.el.git

Make sure the contents of the repo, or just ./znc.el is on your load-path.

;; Install
(require 'znc)

;; Configure
M-x customize-group znc RET

;; Engage!
;; It'll prompt you for a configured server, or tell you to configure one
M-x znc-erc

;; Usage
/reconnect will recycle the hell out of the server buffer.
